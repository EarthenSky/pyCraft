pyCraft - Modified for acacia
=======
see https://github.com/ammaraskar/pyCraft for more information about pyCraft.

Main Changes
------------
Added more packets but also has more dependencies -> needs https://github.com/barneygale/quarry (which also supports 1.7 -> 1.16.4)

Requirements (Updated)
------------
- `cryptography <https://github.com/pyca/cryptography#cryptography>`_
- `requests <http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/>`_
- `future <http://python-future.org/>`_
- `quarry <https://github.com/barneygale/quarry>`_ (new)

The requirements are also stored in ``requirements.txt``

See the installation instructions for the cryptography library here: `<https://cryptography.io/en/latest/installation/>`_
but essentially ``pip install -r requirements.txt`` should cover everything.
